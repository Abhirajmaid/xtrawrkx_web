# üìß Email Service Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up and configure the email notification system for event registrations.

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

The email service uses `nodemailer` for sending emails. It should already be installed, but if not:

```bash
npm install nodemailer
```

### 2. Environment Variables

Add these environment variables to your `.env.local` file:

```env
# Email Configuration (Gmail)
EMAIL_USER=your-gmail-address@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-gmail-app-password

# Admin Email Configuration (comma-separated list)
ADMIN_EMAILS=admin@xtrawrkx.com,support@xtrawrkx.com

# Alternative: Custom SMTP Server
# SMTP_HOST=your-smtp-server.com
# SMTP_PORT=587
# SMTP_SECURE=false
# SMTP_USER=your-email@domain.com
# SMTP_PASS=your-password
```

### 3. Gmail Setup (Recommended)

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** on your Gmail account
2. **Generate App Password**:
   - Go to Google Account settings
   - Security ‚Üí 2-Step Verification ‚Üí App passwords
   - Select "Mail" and generate a password
   - Use this password as `EMAIL_PASS` (not your regular Gmail password)

### 4. Alternative SMTP Setup

For custom SMTP servers, uncomment the alternative configuration in `/app/api/send-email/route.js`:

```javascript
// For custom SMTP server
return nodemailer.createTransporter({
  host: process.env.SMTP_HOST,
  port: process.env.SMTP_PORT,
  secure: process.env.SMTP_SECURE === "true",
  auth: {
    user: process.env.SMTP_USER,
    pass: process.env.SMTP_PASS,
  },
});
```

## üì¨ Email Types & Flow

### Email Recipients for Each Registration:

1. **To User/Company**:

   - Primary contact email
   - Company email (if different from primary contact)

2. **To XtraWrkx Admin**:
   - All emails listed in `ADMIN_EMAILS`
   - Contains full registration details for processing

### 1. Registration Confirmation Email (To User)

**Sent when:**

- User registers but payment is pending

**Features:**

## üîß Email Templates

### Template Structure

Email templates are HTML-based with inline CSS for maximum compatibility:

### Customization

To customize email templates, edit the functions in `/app/api/send-email/route.js`:

   - Confirmation email when payment is completed

### Season Registration Flow

1. **Free Season Registration**: Email sent immediately
2. **Paid Season Registration**:
   - Initial email for registration received

### Email Troubleshooting

**Common Issues & Solutions:**

2. Enable 2-Step Verification
3. Go to App passwords
4. Select "Mail" and generate password
5. Use this 16-character password in `.env.local`

#### 2. **Environment Variables Not Working**

```
Error: Missing required email data
```

**Solutions:**

- ‚úÖ Create `.env.local` file in `/client` directory
- ‚úÖ Restart your development server after adding variables

## üìä Monitoring

### Error Handling

The email service includes robust error handling:

- **Non-blocking**: Email failures don't prevent registration completion
- **Logging**: All email attempts are logged for debugging
- **Graceful Degradation**: Registration works even if email service is down

### Logs

Check browser console for email-related logs:

- `Registration email sent successfully`
- `Payment confirmation email sent successfully`
- `Failed to send email: [error details]`

## üîí Security Best Practices

1. **Environment Variables**: Never commit email credentials to code
2. **App Passwords**: Use Gmail App Passwords instead of regular passwords
3. **Rate Limiting**: Consider adding rate limiting for email API
4. **Validation**: Email addresses are validated before sending

## üìà Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

1. **Email Templates**: Advanced template system with dynamic content
2. **Delivery Tracking**: Track email open rates and delivery status
3. **Bulk Emails**: Support for sending bulk notifications
4. **Email Queue**: Queue system for reliable email delivery
5. **Multiple Providers**: Support for SendGrid, AWS SES, etc.

## üÜò Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Test with a different email address
4. Contact support with error logs

**Note**: Email notifications enhance user experience but are not critical for registration functionality. The system is designed to work reliably even if email services are temporarily unavailable.
