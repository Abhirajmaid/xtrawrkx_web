# 📧 Email System Implementation Summary

## 🔍 **Why Your Emails Weren't Working**

### **Problem 1: Hardcoded Credentials**

- You had email credentials directly in the code
- **Security Risk**: Never commit credentials to code
- **Solution**: Use environment variables

### **Problem 2: Wrong Gmail Password**

- You used regular Gmail password `@bhir@j11166`
- Gmail requires **App Password** for SMTP access
- **Solution**: Generate Gmail App Password

### **Problem 3: Missing Admin Notifications**

- Only users were getting emails
- XtraWrkx wasn't receiving registration details
- **Solution**: Added admin notification system

## 🚀 **How the Email System Works Now**

<diagram>
```
User Registration Flow:
1. User registers for event → Registration saved to database
2. Email service triggered with registration data
3. Two emails sent simultaneously:
   ┌─ To User/Company: Confirmation email
   └─ To XtraWrkx Admin: Registration details
4. If payment completed → Two more emails:
   ┌─ To User/Company: Payment confirmation
   └─ To XtraWrkx Admin: Payment notification
```
</diagram>

### **Email Recipients:**

#### For Each Registration:

- **User Gets**: Registration confirmation + payment confirmation (if paid)
- **Company Gets**: Same emails (if company email ≠ primary contact email)
- **XtraWrkx Admin Gets**: Full registration details + payment notifications

---

## ⚙️ **Setup Requirements**

### **1. Environment Variables** (Add to `.env.local`):

```env
# Email Service
EMAIL_USER=your-gmail-address@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-gmail-app-password  # NOT your regular password!
ADMIN_EMAILS=admin@xtrawrkx.com,support@xtrawrkx.com
```

### **2. Gmail Setup Steps:**

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** on your Gmail
2. **Generate App Password**:
   - Google Account → Security → 2-Step Verification → App passwords
   - Select "Mail" → Generate password
   - Use this 16-character password in `EMAIL_PASS`

### **3. Test the System:**

1. Register for a free event → Check emails
2. Register for paid event → Check initial email
3. Complete payment → Check payment confirmation emails
